## Inspiration
Unemployment is a huge problem all over the world. Many people fall into poverty because of unemployment. We were fortunate enough to be born into well-off families, and we want to be able to give those same opportunities to people in poverty.

## What it does
Our app has the user fill out information, and based upon that the user can choose a job they want to apply to. Our app will then show the user different jobs around them on a map.

## How we built it
We built it using SwiftUI and a beta version of Xcode.
